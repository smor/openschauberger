Open Schauberger
===============

3D CAD models for various Schauberger ideas and inventions, intended to be used by the scientific community for research purposes.

My intent is to provide parametric 3D printable models of projects belonging to or initiated by Victor Schauberger, described in various sources, including, but not limited to patents, books, videos, or websites.

Those models may be built by anyone, in order to experiment with them, and ideally to validate or invalidate their claims through scientific study.

Some of those devices might include:
* Water conduct with wedges (Austrian Patent # 134, 543)
* Improved water conduct (Austrian Patent # 138,296)
* Tubing for Flowing & Gaseous Media (Austrian Patent # 196,680)
* Jet turbine (Austrian Patent # 117,749) *my current target*
* Apparatus for Agitating Body of Fluid (British Patent # 1,187,632)
